                   C++ is an extension of C that works well for
                    programming the systems that run applications, as opposed 
                    to the applications themselves. C++ also works well for 
                    multi-device and multi-platform systems. Over time, programmers
                     have written a large set of libraries and compilers for C++.
                      Being able to use these utilities effectively is just as important
                       to understanding a programming language as writing code,...

                    Benefits of   Java?

                    <b>Benefits:</b><br>
                     Java is the programming language most commonly 
                     associated with the development of client-server applications,
                      which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is
                       designed to be a loosely coupled programming language,
                        meaning that an application written in Java can run on
                         any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is
                          described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.

                     Python is widely regarded as a programming language 
                    that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library
                     of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular
                      programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the 
                      first language that students learn in the Align program,
                       Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts 
                       quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular
                        programming language, especially among startups, and therefore
                         Python skills are in high demand.

                   <b> Benefits:</b>
                   <br> PHP is widely used for server-side web development, 
                    when a website frequently requests information from a server.
                     As an older language, PHP benefits from a large ecosystem of 
                     users who have produced frameworks, libraries, and automation 
                     tools to make the programming language easier to use. PHP code 
                     is also easy to debug.
